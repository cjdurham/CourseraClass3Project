The data in the file is created by importing the various files.  I have combined the X subset of data with the Y identification data for use as a single dataset.  Then the result of those two activities were grouped by Activity and Subject to create the final tidy dataset.

The resulting numbers are the mean of the original figures reported in the dataset grouped by Activity and by Subject.  In this case, Subject is representative of each participant / individuals recorded numbers.


Each of the items below are reported on an X, Y and Z axis as indicated in the naming of each column.  For example, the Angle data as mentioned below is representative of angle(X,gravityMean), angle(Y,gravityMean)	and angle(Z,gravityMean).  The X, Y and Z denoting the axis for each.
